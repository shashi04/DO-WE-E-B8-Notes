1. Created a new EBS Volume 

2. Attached it to a EC2

3. lsblk - To view the disk block

4. Created partition by using fdsik.

sudo fdisk /dev/xvdb (Replace /dev/xvdb with the actual device name of the expanded disk if different.)

View the existing partitions: In the fdisk prompt, type:

p

This shows the existing partitions on the disk.

Create a New Partition:

> Type n to create a new partition.
> Select the partition type:
> Type p for a primary partition.
> Specify the partition number (e.g., 3, if you want to create the third partition).
> Accept the default values for the first and last sectors to use all available space, or specify a size if you want to create a smaller partition.

Write the Changes: After the new partition is created, type:

w

This writes the changes to the disk and exits fdisk.



5. Updated the File System (EXT4)

sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb3


6. Created a Mount Point (/mnt/data)


create a directory where the new partition will be mounted:

sudo mkdir /mnt/data


6. Mount the New Partition

Mount the newly formatted partition to the created directory:

sudo mount /dev/xvdb3 /mnt/data

7. Add the New Partition to /etc/fstab

Open the fstab file for editing:

sudo nano /etc/fstab


Add the following line for your new partition (replace /dev/xvdb3 and /mnt/data with the correct values):

/dev/xvdb3    /mnt/data    ext4    defaults,nofail    0    2


Save and close the file.

8. Verify the Partition

Finally, verify that the partition is mounted and the new space is available:

df -h
