Update the Bucket Policy
You can add a bucket policy to allow public read access to all objects in the bucket. Hereâ€™s an example policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*"
    }
  ]
}



To apply this policy:

Go to the S3 Management Console.
Navigate to your bucket.
Click Permissions > Bucket Policy.
Paste the policy and save.
Replace <bucket-name> with the name of your bucket.


Disable "Block Public Access"
Go to the S3 Management Console.
Navigate to your bucket.
Click Permissions > Block Public Access settings.
Disable "Block all public access" and save.
Be cautious! Disabling this setting makes objects publicly accessible.
