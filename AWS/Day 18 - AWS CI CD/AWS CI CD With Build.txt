
AWS CI CD with Build
====================


Step 1: Prepare Your Application Files and push it to GitHub
-------------------------------------------------------------

Link: https://github.com/shashi04/awsbuildtest

============================================================================================
Step 2: Create a CodeBuild Project:
------------------------------------

Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to CodeBuild → Create Build Project.

Fill out the basic configuration:
-> Project Name: MySampleAppBuild
-> Source Provider: GitHub
-> Connect to GitHub and choose your repository.
-> Branch: main

In the Environment section:
-> Choose Managed Image.
-> Set Operating System to Amazon Linux 2.
-> Set Runtime to Standard.
-> Set Image to the latest version (e.g., aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:4.0).
-> Specify the buildspec.yml file or let AWS automatically detect it.
-> In the Artifacts section, select S3.

============================================================================================
Step 3: Run the Build
----------------------

-> Start the build by clicking Start Build.
-> Monitor logs to verify the build runs successfully.

============================================================================================
Step 4: Validate the Output
----------------------------

-> The output logs should show the "Hello, AWS CodeBuild!" message.

============================================================================================
Step 5: Setup CodePipeline
---------------------------

-> Go to AWS CodePipeline → Create Pipeline.

-> Pipeline Name: MySampleAppPipeline.

-> Source Stage:
-> Source provider: GitHub.
-> Connect to your repository and branch.

Build Stage:
-> Add a build stage with AWS CodeBuild (use the previously created build project).

Deploy Stage:
-> Deployment provider: CodeDeploy.
-> Application name: MySampleAppDeployment.
-> Deployment group: The group created earlier.

============================================================================================
Step 6: Start the Pipeline
---------------------------

-> Push changes to your GitHub repository.

-> The pipeline will automatically trigger:
-> Source stage pulls the code from GitHub.
-> Build stage runs in CodeBuild.
-> Deploy stage pushes the code to EC2 using CodeDeploy.

============================================================================================
Step 7: Validate Deployment
----------------------------

-> SSH into the EC2 instance.
-> Check if the files are in /var/www/html.
-> Access the application via the EC2 public IP.
