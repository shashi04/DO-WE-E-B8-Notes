Access S3 Bucket:

You can now use the aws s3 CLI commands to interact with the S3 bucket.

List Buckets:

aws s3 ls

======================

List Objects in a Bucket:

aws s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>/

=============================

Copy Data from S3 to EC2:

aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/<object-key> /local/path


aws s3 cp s3://shashitestbucket0406/Day\ 1.pdf ~/Day1.pdf

======================================================

Copy All Data from a Bucket to EC2:

aws s3 cp s3://<bucket-name>/ /local/path --recursive

======================================================


Upload the File
Use the aws s3 cp command to upload a file to an S3 bucket.

Syntax:

aws s3 cp /local/file/path s3://<bucket-name>/


Example: To upload a file named example.txt to the bucket mybucket:

aws s3 cp ~/example.txt s3://mybucket/


Output: On success, youâ€™ll see:

upload: ./example.txt to s3://mybucket/example.txt

========================================================================

Specify a Custom Key (Optional)

You can upload the file with a custom name or path in the bucket:

aws s3 cp ~/example.txt s3://mybucket/folder1/custom_name.txt


=======================================================================

To upload an entire folder to an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI, you can use the --recursive option. Here's how:

Command to Upload a Folder
Syntax:

aws s3 cp /local/folder/path s3://<bucket-name>/ --recursive


Example: To upload a folder named myfolder to the bucket mybucket:

aws s3 cp ~/myfolder s3://mybucket/ --recursive

========================================================================

How It Works

The --recursive option ensures that all files and subdirectories inside the specified folder are uploaded to the S3 bucket.
The folder structure is preserved in the bucket.
