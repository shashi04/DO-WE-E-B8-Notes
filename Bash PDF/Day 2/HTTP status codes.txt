HTTP status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. They provide information about the result of the request. They are grouped into five categories based on the first digit of the code.

Hereâ€™s a summary of HTTP status codes:
=======================================

1. 1xx - Informational
=======================

These codes indicate that the request has been received and the process is continuing.

Code	Meaning
100	Continue
101	Switching Protocols
102	Processing

=========================================================================================================================================
2. 2xx - Successful
====================

These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

Code	Meaning
200	OK
201	Created
202	Accepted
204	No Content
205	Reset Content
206	Partial Content
207	Multi-Status

200 OK: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.

201 Created: The request was successful, and a new resource was created.

204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (e.g., after a DELETE operation).

=========================================================================================================================================

3. 3xx - Redirection
=====================

These codes indicate that further action is required to complete the request. This is often used when a resource has been moved.

Code	Meaning
300	Multiple Choices
301	Moved Permanently
302	Found (Previously "Moved Temporarily")
303	See Other
304	Not Modified
305	Use Proxy
307	Temporary Redirect
308	Permanent Redirect

301 Moved Permanently: The resource has permanently moved to a new location.

302 Found: The resource is temporarily available at a different location.

304 Not Modified: The resource has not been modified since the last request, so the cached version can be used.

=========================================================================================================================================

4. 4xx - Client Error
======================

These codes indicate that the client seems to have made an error in the request.

Code	Meaning
400	Bad Request
401	Unauthorized
403	Forbidden
404	Not Found
405	Method Not Allowed
408	Request Timeout
409	Conflict
410	Gone
413	Payload Too Large
414	URI Too Long
415	Unsupported Media Type
429	Too Many Requests

400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed syntax).

401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required and has failed or has not been provided.

403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.

404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found.

408 Request Timeout: The server timed out waiting for the request.

429 Too Many Requests: The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time (rate limiting).

=========================================================================================================================================

5. 5xx - Server Error
======================

These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

Code	Meaning
500	Internal Server Error
501	Not Implemented
502	Bad Gateway
503	Service Unavailable
504	Gateway Timeout
505	HTTP Version Not Supported

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error occurred on the server.

502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.

503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unavailable (usually due to overload or maintenance).

504 Gateway Timeout: The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.

=========================================================================================================================================

Key Takeaways:
===============

2xx codes represent success.

4xx codes represent client errors.

5xx codes represent server errors.

1xx codes are informational responses.

3xx codes indicate redirection.

These status codes help clients (like browsers or API consumers) understand how to proceed with their requests or handle any errors.
